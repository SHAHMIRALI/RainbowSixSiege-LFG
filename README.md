# RainbowSixSiege-LFG
This app allows Rainbow six siege players to make posts about finding/recruiting other players to play matches with. When making posts, players can select what their in game rank is along with what game-mode they will be playing. They can enter their in game name and optionally fetch their stats from online so other players can view them.

## Demo

1-Register user and login to app and click 'make post'

2-Enter information on what you will be advertising when recruiting other players. Also fetch your ingame stats from online so others can see how good you are (kill death ratio and win loss ratio).
